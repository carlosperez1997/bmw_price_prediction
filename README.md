# **BMW Price Prediction**

In this repository, a model is built to predict the price of a second-hand BMW given their features such as: model, mileage, power, color, fuel type... See the model in [[model]]. 

The selected model is a Random Forest Regressor with: n_estimators: 80, max_depth: 50 and min_samples_leaf: 5.

After the model was built a dashboard to enable the user predict the price of a BWM was constructed. **See and test the dashboard in [[dashboard]]!** The code of the dashboard is in [[code]]. The dashboard was built with dash, plotly and python and it was deployed using Heroku. 

Moreover, this dataset was converted to SQL in order to make some queries to showcase how SQL works and practice it [[sql]].
